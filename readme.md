# Bitly url shorterer
You can get a short link from service bitly.
You can count how many times your short link was clicked. 

## How to install
You can get your own APIKEY at the web-site [bitly.com/](https://app.bitly.com/).

Python3 should be already installed. Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
